// });

// Setup
// - store all player metadata in db (player metadata should be updated periodically as new players join queue)
//   - twitch handle
//   - summoner name
//

// Workflow
// - listen to MAX_CHANNELS channels that are (LIVE + playing league of legends)
//   - periodically try listening to unlive channels to see if they're live
// - send !teams msg periodically to every channel
// - check nightbot response
//   - if response is valid AND is not same as cached response, new game has started
//     - we can post to twitter
//     - update cached response
//     - stop listening to channels for all players mentioned in response
//     - start listening to other channels
//   - if response is valid AND same as cached response
//     - do nothing
//   - if response is not valid, do nothing + keep listening

/**
 * Method 1 (send !teams command and listen to nightbot response)
 * pros: don't have to listen to streams infinitely
 * cons: not a good way to validate !teams response (besides adding metadata to msg)
 *
 * - get all channels (from db)
 * - every x minutes, check each channel to see if they're live
 *   - if they are add them to liveChannels list
 *   - if they aren't, remove them from liveChannels list (if they are)
 * - every y minutes, for each live channel
 *   - listen to liveChannel messages
 *   - send '!teams' message
 *   - wait for nightbot response

//
/**
 * Method 2 (listen to all channels for mod msg)
 * pros: don't have to worry about outdated msgs + can work with people who don't have nightbot
 * cons: have to listen to streams for longer
 *
 * - get all channels (from db)
 * - every x minutes, check each channel to see if they're live + playing league
 *   - if they are add them to liveChannels list
 *   - if they aren't, remove them from liveChannels list (if they are)
 * - for each live channel (periodically update this list)
 *   - listen to messages
 *   - wait for mod message to set !teams command
 *   - when mod message arrives,
 *     - stop listening to channel
 *     - add to pendingChannels (should also contain timestamp of when pendingChannels was added)
 *     - post tweet!
 * - every y minutes check pendingChannels, if 20 min has passed since added, add back to list
